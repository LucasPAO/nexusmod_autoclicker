**What is this for:**

This program is to designed to be used with Wabbajack.

.

**Why:**

With a FREE account, download speed is limited to 1.5-3MB/s, and you have to manually download each mod.

Therefore, this program will help you download hundreds of mods. (I'm looking at you Eldergleam). 

.

**Effiency:**

On average, it will download a mod every 12 seconds.

In 5 minutes, it downloaded 25 mods.

Sometimes it will scroll past the download button and will take 24 seconds to download the mod.

.

**How it works:**

The program checks for the following images, in this order: ("custom_download.png", "download.png", "lr_download.png", "hr_download.png").

It compares each image to the screen, moves your mouse to the button and left click. (custom_download.png found!)

If no button is found, it will scroll down 4 times and repeat the process.

If still nothing is found, it will move to the top and output: Button not found. Awaiting 8 seconds

.

**Tips:**

 - **Make sure to change "Remind me about file ratings" to *Never*** in Site preferences.

   Click on your profile, Site preferences, Global (Remind me about file ratings).

   If you don't change it, there is a chance that while the program is running, the reminder **will cause it to loop forever**.

 - **Do not zoom in or out**, due to the size of the buttons, if you resize the Nexusmod page, there is a high chance that it won't be able to find the button.

   If it happens, manually download the mod and wait for the automatic window resize of Wabbajack.

   After that, the program will run normal.

 - Be advised to check occasionally if everything is working fine.

 - Sometimes it may open donate page or another program due to window size, moving your mouse while it is running and etc.

 - Your PC may slow down.

 - While the program is running, **only use it for Wabbajack**.

 - Due to its simple complexity, it will not work if **more than one monitor** is connected when it is running.

 - You can change "custom_download.png" for another button or to increase accuracy. 
It will be the first template that the program will compare.

 - Set your screen to stay awake, leave it running and go to sleep. (-_-)zzz

**FAQ**

**1. Q: It says "Button not found. Scrolling down. / Button not found. Awaiting 8 seconds" even with Wabbajack open and in fullscreen.**

  **A:** One of two:
  The size of the buttons were done in 1080p. If you have a 2K or 4K monitor, the program may not be able to find the button due to the UI scaling. 

  Or
  
  If there is an overlay app, that changes your screen color/alpha or that adds effects, it may affect the program.

 **In any case**
 
     1.1 To fix it, you need to:

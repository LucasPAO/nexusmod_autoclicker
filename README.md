**What is this for:**

This program is to be used in WABBAJACK.

.

**Why:**

With a FREE account, the limit of download is 2-3MB/S and you have to manually download each mod (click).

To make it easier to download 1500mods or so, (I'm looking at you Eldergleam). 

.

**How it works:**

The program will search for the button "Slow" / "Slow Download" or "Manual" on screen, move your mouse and click.

There is a delay between each click of 7 seconds.

.

**Tips:**

Be advised, watch from time to time if everything is working.

Sometimes it can open donate page or other program due to window size, moving your mouse while it is working and etc...

Your PC may slow down.

For the time it is working, only use it for Wabbajack.

File "download75.png" and "slow75.png" are files that you can change for other type of buttons or to increase accuracy.

Set it (screen) to stay awake, left it there and go to sleep.

.

**How can I download:**

Go to releases, download the .zip from Google Drive.

Open "NexusSlowClicker.exe"

Set Wabbajack to fullscreen and the browser window (pop up for download)

.

**FAQ**

**1. Q: It says "Button not found. Awaiting 7 seconds" even with Wabbajack open and in fullscreen.**

  **A:** The size of the buttons was done in a 1080p and should not be a problem. Close any overlay apps that
   might change your screen color/alpha or that add effects.

     1.1 If you do not have any program, then:

      Close the program.

      Printscreen the button on your screen.

      Crop it in a way that shows "SLOW" or "SLOW DOWNLOAD" without any obstructions, e.g.

      Change your button and rename it "download" or "downloadslow", if it is the case.

      Paste it inside the main folder.

      Start NexusSlowClicker.exe

**3. Q: How to stop the program?**

   **A:** Press "CTRL + C".
